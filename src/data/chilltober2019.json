  "detailsText": "Every year, artists from all over the world join the Inktober challenge of draw a daily drawing throughout the month of October. <br><br>Inktober is a challenge that I have always dreamed of doing, but I never felt ready to participate, since I do not consider myself an artist or with any gift for drawing. But I decided to challenge myself and face my fears. So I joined #Chilltober2019, to make that good habit of drawing and lose my fear of trying.<br><br>Something I did to make this challenge more interesting for me was to choose a new tool and see how much I was able to learn in the course of a month.<br><br>For 2019 I chose Invision Studio, since it was a new and quite interesting tool for prototyping interfaces and at the same time adding motion. So I wanted to learn how to use it by making short animated clips.<br><br>And this was the result of this challenge  (or you can watch it on my <a href=\"https://dribbble.com/filaudeves\" target=\"_blank\">Dribbble</a>):",
